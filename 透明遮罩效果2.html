     <p>The text fades out at the bottom and has a "More..." link. Text fade out is nothing new around here. But since this is a slightly different idea and the times-are-a-changin' and we can get a bit more progressive with this idea.
     </p><p>
     The box will be limited in height by the appropriate property max-height with it's overflow set to hidden. We'll also use relative positioning as we will need that to use absolute positioning on the read-more paragraph, which is locked to the bottom of the box and uses CSS3 gradients to achieve the text fade out.
